      #FIXME: Preserved in the likelihood that a subsequent WINE version will
      #yet again break F/SN, at which we'll have to temporarily pin against a
      #WINE version known to support F/SN. Thankfully, WINE is behaving itself.
      # The Ultimate Edition installer is fundamentally broken under WINE >=
      # 6.6.1 < 6.14.3, which silently pretends to succeed despite failing to
      # do anything with command-line errors resembling:
      #     0108:err:module:import_dll Library setupapi.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\windows\\system32\\user32.dll") not found
      #     0108:err:module:import_dll Library ucrtbase.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\windows\\system32\\version.dll") not found
      #     0108:err:module:import_dll Library version.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\windows\\system32\\user32.dll") not found
      #     0108:err:module:import_dll Library user32.dll (which is needed by L"C:\\windows\\system32\\start.exe") not found
      # This is a well-known issue purportedly resolved by WINE 6.7:
      #     https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=35192
      # Since we can confirm that WINE 6.10 suffers the same exact issue, we
      # avoid all WINE versions in this problematic range. See also this list
      # of supported Lutris runners:
      #     https://lutris.net/api/runners
      # In order to keep with the newer versions of wine the default version is set to 8.26. This has been tested and shown to work.
